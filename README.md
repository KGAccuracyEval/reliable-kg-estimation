Data accuracy is a fundamental dimension of data quality, especially when dealing with KGs. Auditing the accuracy of KGs is essential. However, manually evaluating the accuracy of large-scale KGs is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, this research focuses on developing efficient sampling techniques for estimating KG accuracy.
